In this project, we created a  CLI (Command Line Interface) using Python language where a user can create his individual / business account from 20 different banks. <br>
Additionally, they can take a loan from the branch of that bank and repay their loan amounts in installments or full payment. <br>
All of these is handled and updated in MySQL Database system.
