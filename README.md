## Description:
The Banking System is a Python-based command-line application integrated with an SQL database to simulate core banking operations. It provides a simple and secure solution for managing accounts, handling loans, and processing transactions. Designed with a focus on usability, the CLI-based system is efficient for real-time operations. In this project, we created a  CLI (Command Line Interface) using Python language where a user can create his individual / business account from 20 different banks. <br>

## Features:
<b> Account Creation: </b> Easily create new user accounts with necessary details. <br>
<b> Loan Management: </b> Manage loans, including applying for loans and repayment schedules. <br>
<b> Fund Transfers: </b> Perform secure transfers between user accounts. <br>
<b> Repayment Handling: </b> Track and process loan repayments effectively. <br>
<b> Transaction Logs: </b> Maintain a detailed record of all operations for auditing. <br>
<b> Database Integration: </b> Stores account and transaction data securely using SQL. <br>
<b> Command-Line Interface: </b> Provides a lightweight and user-friendly interface for operations.
